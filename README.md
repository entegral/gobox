## Introduction

The dynamo package is a Go package that provides functionality for working with DynamoDB, a NoSQL database service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS).

The purpose of the dynamo package is to simplify the interaction with DynamoDB by providing a set of convenient methods and functions. It abstracts away the complexities of working directly with the DynamoDB API and allows developers to focus on their application logic.

With the dynamo package, you can perform operations such as creating, updating, and deleting items in DynamoDB, as well as querying and scanning the database for specific data. It provides a high-level interface that makes it easier to work with DynamoDB in Go projects.

The package includes features such as creating and managing DynamoDB tables, performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on items, executing queries and scans, and handling errors and retries. It aims to provide a seamless and efficient experience for developers working with DynamoDB in their Go applications.

By using the dynamo package, developers can leverage the power and scalability of DynamoDB while writing clean and concise code. It simplifies the integration of DynamoDB into Go projects and helps developers build robust and efficient applications that utilize the capabilities of DynamoDB.
